# Android APK Deployment Guide

## ðŸš€ Current Status

Your Cloud Build now generates Android APKs automatically! Build ID: `5e230cc3-24b3-4788-a696-9b30af359dfb` is currently building both web and Android versions.

## ðŸ“± Download APK from Cloud Build

```bash
# Wait for build to complete
gcloud builds list --project=fitness-tracker-8d0ae --limit=1

# Download the APK when build is SUCCESS
gsutil cp gs://fitness-tracker-8d0ae_cloudbuild/artifacts/build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-release.apk ./fitness-tracker.apk
```

### Option 2: Cloud Console
1. Go to [Cloud Build History](https://console.cloud.google.com/cloud-build/builds?project=fitness-tracker-8d0ae)
2. Click on the latest successful build
3. Go to **Artifacts** tab
4. Download `app-release.apk`

## ðŸ“² Install APK on Android Phone

### Method 1: ADB (if phone connected to computer)
```bash
# Enable USB debugging on your phone first
adb install fitness-tracker.apk
```

### Method 2: Direct Transfer
1. Transfer `fitness-tracker.apk` to your phone (email, cloud drive, USB)
2. On your phone, enable **Settings > Security > Install from Unknown Sources**
3. Use a file manager to navigate to the APK

### Method 3: QR Code (if you have a web server)

## ðŸ”§ Build Artifacts Generated

Each successful build creates:
- `app-release.apk` - For direct installation/testing
- `app-release.aab` - For Google Play Store upload

## ðŸ§ª Testing Checklist

After installing the APK on your phone:
- [ ] App launches successfully
- [ ] Google Sign-In works (uses production Firebase config)
- [ ] User can create profile and set goals
- [ ] Calorie tracking functions work
- [ ] Exercise logging functions work
- [ ] Weight tracking works
- [ ] Reports generation works
- [ ] Data syncs with web app (same Firebase project)

## ðŸš¨ Important Notes

### Firebase Configuration
The Android app uses the same Firebase project (`fitness-tracker-8d0ae`) as your web app, so:
- âœ… User accounts are shared between web and mobile
- âœ… All data syncs automatically
- âœ… Google Sign-In is pre-configured

### APK Signing
The APK is signed with a debug key for testing. For Play Store deployment, you'll need:
1. Upload key generation
2. Play Console setup
3. Release signing configuration

## ðŸŽ¯ Next Steps

1. **Test the APK** - Install and verify all features work
2. **User Feedback** - Share with test users for feedback
3. **Play Store Setup** - When ready for public release
