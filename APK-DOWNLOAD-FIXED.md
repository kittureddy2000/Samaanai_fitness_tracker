# ✅ APK Download - Correct Method

## 🎯 You Found the Right Path!

**Your APK Path:** `gs://fitness-tracker-8d0ae_cloudbuild/artifacts/app-debug.apk#1753372309215099`

The `#1753372309215099` is just a version identifier - you can ignore it for downloads.

## 💻 Method 1: Command Line (Easiest)

```bash
# Download directly using the path you found
gsutil cp gs://fitness-tracker-8d0ae_cloudbuild/artifacts/app-debug.apk ./fitness-tracker-debug.apk
```

**✅ This worked!** APK downloaded: **191.4 MB** (200,688,099 bytes)

## 🌐 Method 2: Web Interface Download

If you want a direct download link from the web console:

1. **Go to Cloud Storage Console:**
   - Open: https://console.cloud.google.com/storage/browser/fitness-tracker-8d0ae_cloudbuild/artifacts?project=fitness-tracker-8d0ae

2. **Find the APK:**
   - Look for `app-debug.apk`
   - Click the **3-dot menu** next to the file
   - Click **"Download"**

3. **Alternative - Direct Link:**
   - Right-click on the filename
   - Select **"Copy link address"**
   - Paste in browser for direct download

## 📱 Install on Your Phone

### Option A: Transfer and Install
1. **Copy APK to phone:**
   ```bash
   # Copy to Desktop first for easy transfer
   cp fitness-tracker-debug.apk ~/Desktop/
   ```

2. **Transfer to phone** (email, USB, cloud drive)

3. **Install on phone:**
   - Enable "Install from Unknown Sources" in Settings
   - Tap the APK file to install

### Option B: Direct ADB Install
```bash
# If phone is connected via USB with Developer Mode enabled
adb install fitness-tracker-debug.apk
```

## 🔍 Why No Direct Link in Cloud Build Console?

The Cloud Build **Artifacts** tab sometimes doesn't show direct download buttons. Instead:
- It shows the **storage path** (which you found correctly!)
- You need to use either:
  - `gsutil cp` command (what we did)
  - Cloud Storage console (for web download)
